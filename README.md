# Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Machine Learning Projects

This repository showcases hands-on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** projects designed to build strong foundations for **AI Intern** and **Machine Learning Engineer** roles.  
The focus is on **end-to-end ML workflows**, clean experimentation, and scalable code structure.
